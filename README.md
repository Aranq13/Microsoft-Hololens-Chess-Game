# The Newest Newest Version

Contains:
- Scaled down board, pieces and highlights as per the Hololens demo
- Castling move
- Check recognition (checkmate still a work in progress)
- Most bugs from piece movement should be fixed (hopefully)
- When a player is in check, they now must make a move that takes themselves out of check
