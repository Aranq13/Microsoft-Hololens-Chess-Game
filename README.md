# The Newest Newest Version

Contains:
- Scaled down board, pieces and highlights as per the Hololens demo
- Castling move
- Check recognition
- Most bugs from piece movement should be fixed (hopefully)
- When a player is in check, they now must make a move that takes themselves out of check
- Console will print checkmate when checkmate occurs, and stalemate if a stalemate occurs

What needs to be added to this version:
- Pawn promotion
- Tile highlight turns red when a take is available
- En passant (?)
